# AI Safety Study Group

AI Safety Study Group is a group of learners interested in AI Safety. We aim to explore the ethical, social, and technical challenges that arise when developing AI systems that can be used for harm. Check our [homepage](https://aisafetystudy.gixia.org/) to join the community.

### Build & Deploy

Currently it's a small project and directly running on Azure machine. 

#### Option 1: Direct deployment (single app)
Run following to build and start the web app:
```
npm run build
pm2 start npm --name "aisafetystudy" -- run start
# Or restart if already running
# pm2 restart aisafetystudy
```

#### Option 2: Multi-app deployment with nginx
For multiple apps with different subdomains:
```bash
# Build and start this app on port 3000
npm run build
PORT=3000 pm2 start npm --name "aisafetystudy" -- run start
```

#### Nginx Configuration
Create `/etc/nginx/sites-available/react-apps`:
```nginx
# AI Safety Study Group - aisafetystudy.gixia.org
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name aisafetystudy.gixia.org;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Enable the configuration:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/react-apps /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```
